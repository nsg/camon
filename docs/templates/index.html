    <p class="hero-description">A multi-camera video recording and analytics system built in Rust. Camon ingests RTSP streams from IP cameras, intelligently detects motion and objects, and automatically archives only what matters — discarding hours of uneventful footage while preserving critical moments.</p>
    <p class="hero-description" style="margin-top: var(--space-md);">Powered by GStreamer for efficient stream handling, OpenCV for motion detection, and ONNX Runtime for AI-based object recognition. Designed for reliability, low resource usage, and seamless operation across multiple cameras.</p>
